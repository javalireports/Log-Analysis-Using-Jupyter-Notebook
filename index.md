## Welcome to Javali Reports

I would like to introduce you to [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) another efficient tool that is an open-source interactive notebook that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Jupyter Notebook is maintained by the people at [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). 

On my github page, I have tried to demo an approach for log analysis that mixes a bit of data science and domain-specific knowledge (DFIR â€“ Digital Forensics and Incident Response).
